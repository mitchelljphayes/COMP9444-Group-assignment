(c) You nally design the following pipeline:
Figure 2: The input camera image is given to two modules: the Car Detector Cand the
Pedestrian Detector P.Coutputs a set of bounding boxes localizing the cars. Poutputs a set
of bounding boxes localizing the pedestrians. The bounding boxes are then given to a Path
PlannerSwhich outputs the steering angle. Assume all these submodules are supervised
learning algorithms.
(i)(3 points) What data do you need to train the submodules in the pipeline pre-
sented in Figure 2?
Solution:
•To train the Car Detector, we need to collect Xc(images from a camera
hood of a car) and Yc(bounding box labels localizing the cars.)
•To train the Pedestrian Detector, we need to collect Xp(images from a
camera hood of a car) and Yp(bounding box labels localizing the pedes-
trians.)
•To train the Path planner, we need to collect Xs(bounding boxes local-
izing the cars and the pedestrians) and Ys(steering angle.)
(ii)(3 points) Explain how you would collect this data.
Solution:
•(Xc;Yc) : Put a camera on the hood of a car, label the bounding boxes
by hand. You can also download images from roads online or use online
datasets such as COCO or PASCAL VOC.
•(Xp;Yp) : Put a camera on the hood of a car, label the bounding boxes
by hand. You can also download images from roads online or use online
datasets such as COCO or PASCAL VOC.
•(Xs;Ys) : Put a camera on the hood of a car, label the bounding boxes by

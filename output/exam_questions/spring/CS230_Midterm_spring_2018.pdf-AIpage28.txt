        "answer": "Training set. Reasons include: {Neural networks are very data intensive. Therefore, opportunities to increase the dataset should not be missed. {The new data in the training set could help the neural network to learn better lower level features (as you have more data) {Using the new data in the dev/test set would change the goal/target of the optimization process. Thus, the optimized system would not perform well with real world data.",

Measure the difference of accuracy between the new training set and train-dev set. If there is a significant difference, then the distribution mismatch between the old and new images is a problem.",

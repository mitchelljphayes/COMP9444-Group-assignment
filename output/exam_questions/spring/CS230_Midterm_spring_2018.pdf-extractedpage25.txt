Consider the following 3-layer X-network, made of X-neurons exclusively.
Figure 5: The input is a vector xof shape (nx;1), which is duplicated and given to every
X-neuron of the rst layer. The X-network consists of three layers in which layer 1 has
n[1]X-neurons, layer 2 has n[2]X-neurons, and layer 3 has a single X-neuron. Although for
simplicity we did not draw all arrows, every layer is fully-connected to the next one.
(a) Given that all X-neurons in your network output a vector of shape ( D;1):
(i)(2 points) What is the dimension of W[2]
ji, for a single X-neuron in layer 2 of your
X-network?
Solution: DD
(ii)(2 points) What is the dimension of W[1]
ji, for a single X-neuron in layer 1 of your
network?
Solution: Dnx
(b)(2 points) For thejthX-neuron of the 2ndlayer, how many weights ( c[l]
ij) does it have
in its stage 2?

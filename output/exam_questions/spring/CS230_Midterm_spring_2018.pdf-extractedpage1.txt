Question 1 (Multiple Choice Questions, 14 points)
For each of the following questions, circle the letter of your choice. There is only ONE correct
choice unless explicitly mentioned. No explanation is required.
(a)(2 points) Which of the following is true about max-pooling?
(i) It allows a neuron in a network to have information about features in a larger
part of the image, compared to a neuron at the same depth in a network without
max pooling.
(ii) It increases the number of parameters when compared to a similar network with-
out max pooling.
(iii) It increases the sensitivity of the network towards the position of features within
an image.
Solution: (i)
(b)(2 points) In order to backpropagate through a max-pool layer, you need to pass
information about the positions of the max values from the forward pass.
(i) True
(ii) False
Solution: (i)
(c)(2 points) Consider a simple convolutional neural network with one convolutional
layer. Which of the following statements is true about this network? (Check all that
apply.)
(i) It is scale invariant.
(ii) It is rotation invariant.
(iii) It is translation invariant.
(iv) All of the above.
Solution: (iii)
(d)(2 points) You are training a Generative Adversarial Network to generate nice iguana
images, with mini-batch gradient descent. The generator cost J(G)is extremely low,
but the generator is not generating meaningful output images. What could be the
reason? (Circle all that apply.)

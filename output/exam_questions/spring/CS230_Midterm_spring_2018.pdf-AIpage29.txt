    "question": "Initially, you decide to build a fully connected neural network for the problem. This baseline model would have L hidden layers, one input layer and an output layer. The number of neurons in the lth layer isn[l]. Write down the number of parameters of this model as a function of L and n[l] for l = 0, ..., L. Note: The input layer is considered to be layer number 0",
    "choices": [],
    "answer": "PL\ni=0(n[l+1] * (n[l] + n[l+1])) = PL\ni=0(n[l+1] * (n[l] + 1))",

    "question": "Based on the information provided in the graph below, what type of problem will you encounter as the number of hidden layer approaches 10? Mention possible solutions to this problem.",
    "choices": [],
    "answer": "Overfitting problem. Possible solutions are: \n- Regularization: Parameter norm penalties (L2/L1), Dropout. \n- Reduce complexity of the neural network (decrease number of neurons and hidden layers) \n- Increase the training dataset. Data Augmentation/GANs",

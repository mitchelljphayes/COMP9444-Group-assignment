CS230
(i) The discriminator has poor performance.
(ii) Your generator is overtting.
(iii) Your optimizer is stuck in a saddle point.
(iv) None of the above.
Solution: (i)
(e)(2 points) Mini-batch gradient descent is a better optimizer than full-batch gradient
descent to avoid getting stuck in saddle points.
(i) True
(ii) False
Solution: (i)
(f)(2 points) Using "neural style transfer" (as seen in class), you want to generate an
RGB image of the Great Wall of China that looks like it was painted by Picasso. The
size of your image is 100x100x3 and you are using a pretrained network with 1,000,000
parameters. At every iteration of gradient descent, how many updates do you perform?
(i) 10,000
(ii) 30,000
(iii) 1,000,000
(iv) 1,030,000
Solution: (ii) You only update the image, i.e. 10,000 pixels and each pixel has
3 channels.
(g)(2 points) You are building a model to predict the presence (labeled 1) or absence
(labeled 0) of a tumor in a brain scan. The goal is to ultimately deploy the model to
help doctors in hospitals. Which of these two metrics would you choose to use?
(i) Precision =True positive examples
Total predicted positive examples
(ii) Recall =True positive examples
Total positive examples.

CS230
Solution:
(1) Loss value (or error)
(2) Number of iterations
(3) Best validation loss value (or best validation error)
(4) Optimal stopping point (or early stopping point)
(5) Validation loss (or validation error)
(6) Training loss (or training error)
(h)(2 point) Look at the grayscale image at the top of the collection of images below.
Deduce what type of convolutional lter was used to get each of the lower images.
Explain briey and include the values of these lters. The lters have a shape of (3,3).

CS230
Calculate the error between the original path and the expert's new path to
get an estimate of human level error on this task.
(iii)(3 points) Human level performance is 96% for your task. Your pipeline should
do a lot better! Assuming one component (among C,PandS) is failing, explain
how you would identify which one it is.
Solution: Replace every component in turn with the ground truth. For
example if you are testing whether Cis failing, supply Swith ground truth
bounding boxes of all the cars, and see if performance of the overall pipeline
increases. If it increases signicantly, it is likely that the failing component is
C.
(iv)(3 points) You have identied that the failing component is P.Pfails at de-
tecting pedestrians in 3 distinct settings: at night, when it is snowing, and when
it is raining. You cannot solve the 3 problems at once. How would you decide
which of the 3 problems to focus on rst?
Solution: Do an error analysis. Ascertain how much of your error is due
to each of the three cases, by using images only from these cases. Then focus
on the case which contributes the most to your error. You could also choose
to based your choice in practical situations. If Potato Inc. is in a place which
has high rainfall, you might want to focus on the errors made on images with
rain.
(f)(2 points) After xing the only failing component, your pipeline gets a score of 67%.
What could be wrong?
Solution: Each of the modules has been trained independently and on perfect
outputs from the other components. It is likely that small perturbations/errors
in the output of previous components is aecting the performance of the other
components, leading to a snowballing of errors.

Solution: Adversarial examples are transferable, and so Alice can use Fast
Gradient Sign Based Method on a dierent model, built for the same task (cat vs.
non-cat classication), and it is likely that this adversarial example will also be
misclassied by Bob's model.
(f)(2 points) To defend himself against Alice's attacks, Bob is thinking of using dropout.
Dropout randomly shuts down certain neurons of the network, and makes it more
robust to changes in the input. Thus, Bob has the intuition that the network will be
less vulnerable to adversarial examples. Is Bob correct? Explain why or why not.
Solution: No, dropout isn't used at test time while Alice will forge her adversarial
examples by querying a network at test time.

Question 1 (Multiple Choice Questions, 10 points)
For each of the following questions, circle the letter of your choice. There is only ONE correct
choice unless explicitly mentioned. No explanation is required. There is no penalty for a
wrong answer.
(a)(1 point) Which of the following techniques does NOT prevent a model from overt-
ting?
(i) Data augmentation
(ii) Dropout
(iii) Early stopping
(iv) None of the above
Solution: (iv)
(b)(3 points) Consider the following data sets:
•Xtrain= (x(1);x(2);:::;x(mtrain));Ytrain= (y(1);y(2);:::;y(mtrain))
•Xtest= (x(1);x(2);:::;x(mtest));Ytest= (y(1);y(2);:::;y(mtest))
You want to normalize your data before training your model. Which of the following
propositions are true? (Circle all that apply.)
(i) The normalizing mean and variance computed on the training set, and used to
train the model, should be used to normalize test data.
(ii) Test data should be normalized with its own mean and variance before being fed
to the network at test time because the test distribution might be dierent from
the train distribution.
(iii) Normalizing the input impacts the landscape of the loss function.
(iv) In imaging, just like for structured data, normalization consists in subtracting the
mean from the input and multiplying the result by the standard deviation.
Solution: (i) and (iii)

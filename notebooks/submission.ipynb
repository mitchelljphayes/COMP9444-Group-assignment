    "# Evaluating LLM Variants on the Deep Learning Domain\n",
    "----\n",
    "The explosive popularity of large langauge models (LLMs) since the introduction of chatGPT has brought incredible attention and enthusiasm for businesses and people in general to use and benefit from these breakthrough foundational technologies. However there still exists significant hurdles and gatekeepers to wide spread adoption of this technology. One of these is the closed source nature of OpenAI, another is the monumental computation power needed to train and deploy such a model, and finally the general concern about who's data is being used and how can you trust the information being provided. LLMs are known to confidently state things which are absolutely not factual, yet these non-facts are phrased in very absolute terms, this phenomenon is known as hallucination. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hallucinations are a major cause of concern as human users are not accustomed to such confident falsehoods, and generally believe something if it is presented with high levels of confidence. Hallucinations also pose major issues in business applications, where businesses cannot trust an LLM to represent them nor their products truthfully. Another area that hallucinations will hold back the adoption of these advanced tools is in education, whereby a student cannot be confident that the LLM is telling them a fact that should be noted or a complete fabrication. In this notebook we atempt to explore some potential solutions to this situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "Large language models often suffer from hallucinations, or are largely closed source systems with unknown training data making them inaccessible and unreliable for a large number of use cases. We want to understand if \"Retrieval Augmented Generation\" and or \"Fine Tuning\" on domain specific datasets can decrease the incidence of hallucinations and improve accuracy of responses from open source LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project\n",
    "In order to research this question we will explore the topic of building a \"study buddy\" who is an expert in a specific domain, and can answer questions related to the Deep Learning domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two domain specific datasets\n",
    "First we needed access to a domain specific corpus that we could help augment our base models. We obtained 5 common and publicly available textbooks in the Machine Learning and Deep learning domain. We then converted them into a text corpus containing 8605 rows, and a set of 636 question answer pairs, by using [GPT3.5-turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) to analyse the texts and create question answer pairs. \n",
    "The textbooks included were: \n",
    "- Deep Learning - Goodfellow et al\n",
    "- Data Science and ML, Mathematical and Statistical Methods - Kroese et al\n",
    "- Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem - Abhishek Thakur \n",
    "- Machine Learning for Humans - Maini et al   \n",
    "- Mathematics for Machine Learning - Deisenroth et al\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Question answering performance from two Open Source LLMs\n",
    "We looked at the [Falcon-7B-Instruct model](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct), as it performs well on public benchmarks as the basis for SOTA methods in the open source community. We also looked at GPT2, as a smaller simpler model that is lightweight and easy to finetune. Specifically we looked at [distilGPT2](https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2) a re-engineered open source version of GPT2 that is trained on [OpenWebText](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Skylion007/openwebtext)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finetuning vs Retrival Augmented Generation\n",
    "We looked at two methods of introducing domain specific data and decreasing hallucination; finetuning and retrival augmented generation (RAG). \n",
    "\n",
    "For both base models we applied the same finetuning approach. Initially we finetuned the models on the [textbook corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mjphayes/textbook_dataset), then to re-align the model to the nature of our intended prompting we ran a small finetuning training on roughly 20% of the [custom question answer pairs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mjphayes/machine_learning_questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the RAG approach, we ingested the text corpus of the text books into a vector store, by tokenizing and converting overlapping chunks of text into vector emmbeddings, which were then searchable for semantic similarity with the presented question. When the question is presented, it is tokenised in the same way and the most similar chunks of text are presented to the model as part of the prompt. This allows the model to essentially \"get the answers\" before needing to generate an answer to the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately there wasn't a suitable adapter for the GPT2 model, so this technique was only applied to the Falcon model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Notebook - How to use\n",
    "You can run this notebook top to bottom, although it will need to down load the datasets and the falcon model, which are large and take a lot of time. Inference over the evaluation questions also takes approximately 1 hour per model (less on GPT2 more on Falcon). So running this notebook top to bottom will take you ~6-8 hours including training times. Not recommended. Instead, the datasets and results have already been run and their outputs are visible. You can also run just the results section, which will download the precomputed CSV's of the results from a github Gist. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, all the datasources can be downloaded and ran from within the notebook, it will also create a cache and directory structure, so if you do download a model to machine that can run the models then it will cache it to prevent you from needing to run it again. "

    "The base model of Falcon outperforms its other iterations as it demonstrated superior performance right from the start. We can also see that GPT2 performed more poorly as well. When lookin at the F1 scores it seems there were a lot of empty scores for GPT2-finetuned which may have been caused by a token length issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG model performed reasonably well with a slight improvement in accuracy, when the threshold for correctness is an F1 score greater than 0.8\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that the reason is the training on raw textbook content which might affect the previous alignment training that had already been done on these models. \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems clear that the finetuning methodology used caused the models to include nonsensical trailing data which negatively impacted the BertScore Metric.  "

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The obstacles encountered in this project were diverse and spanned across both data curation and technological elements of our models. Data curation—a vital process for our model's domain awareness—requires extensive time and resources. Both fine-tuned and RAG models also exhibited a propensity to generate incorrect or \"hallucinated\" responses when faced with queries beyond their augmented data's context. The increased duration for RAG inference due to an additional retrieval phase was another issue. Moreover, evaluating these models is currently restricted to text-based data, thereby hindering their interaction with different modalities such as diagrams and confining their usefulness in varied educational environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore the generated questions often contained overly specific questions based on figures or examples listed in the text, rather than simply domain specific questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Should timing allow, there are multiple potential paths to improving our outcomes. One method might include bolstering synthetic data generation through additional annotations or testing different prompting tactics. Expanding the vector database to cover a wider array of content—for instance, integrating more textbooks—would likely enhance the RAG model's performance. Alternatives such as optimizing tokenization and indexing strategies or utilizing summarized content instead of entire texts might further improve RAG's efficiency. Finally, extending the training and evaluation of these models to incorporate multi-modal data could potentially widen their use and augment their interaction abilities in educational scenarios."

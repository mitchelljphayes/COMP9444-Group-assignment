  {
    "question": "What role does the zero vector play when discussing the solutions of linear equations in the context of matrix column combinations?",
    "answer": "The zero vector plays a crucial role when discussing the solutions of linear equations in the context of matrix column combinations because it represents a combination of variables that have no effect when added to a particular solution.

  },
  {
    "question": "Can you describe the thought process behind generating non-trivial versions of zero using matrix columns?",

This means that the third and fourth columns can be represented as linear combinations of the first two columns, which helps to find a general solution to the system by introducing scalars that represent degrees of freedom."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an example of how to derive a non-trivial version of zero from the columns of the matrix in system 2.38?",
    "answer": "An example of how to derive a non-trivial version of zero from the columns of the matrix in system 2.38 is by taking 8 times the first column plus 2 times the second column minus 1 times the third column, which results in the zero vector. Similarly, taking -4 times the first column plus 12 times the second column minus 1 times the fourth column also results in the zero vector. These combinations can be scaled by any real number lambda to produce an infinite number of non-trivial zeroes."

    "answer": "An affine subspace is a subset of a vector space that can be obtained by translating a linear subspace by a fixed vector. It is no longer a vector subspace if the translation is non-zero."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between linear and affine mappings?",

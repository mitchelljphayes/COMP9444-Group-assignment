Macro precision is a type of precision that is used to represent the precision of a number in a programming language. It is typically used to represent decimal numbers, such as integers or floating-point numbers.

The computation of macro precision is more complicated than that of weighted precision because it involves more complex arithmetic operations. In contrast, the computation of weighted precision is simpler because it only involves basic arithmetic operations.

For example, to compute the weighted precision of a number, you can simply add or subtract a fixed number to the number. However, to compute the macro precision of a number, you need to perform more complex arithmetic operations, such as multiplication or division.

It can be used to estimate generalization error of a learning algorithm A when the given dataset D is too small for a simple train/test or train/valid split to yield accurate estimation of generalization error, because the mean of a loss L on a small test set may have too high variance. The dataset D contains as elements the abstract examples z( )i (for the i-th example), which could stand for an (input,target) pair z( )i = (x( )i , y( )i ) in the case of supervised learning, or for just an input z ( )i = x( )i in the case of unsupervised learning. The algorithm returns the vector of errors e for each example in D, whose mean is the estimated generalization error. The errors on individual examples can be used to compute a conﬁdence interval around the mean (equation
). While these conﬁdence intervals are not well-justiﬁed after the use of cross-validation, it is still common practice to use them to declare that algorithm A is better than algorithm B only if the conﬁdence interval of the error of algorithm A lies below and does not intersect the conﬁdence interval of algorithm B",-0.10379289,-0.36249122,0.1818702

    Cross-validation is a method of estimating the generalization error of a learning
    algorithm. It can be used to estimate generalization error of a learning algorithm
    A when the given dataset D is too small for a simple train/test or train/valid
    split to yield accurate estimation of generalization error, because the mean of a
    loss L on a small test set may have too high variance. The dataset D contains as
    elements the abstract examples z( )i (for the i-th example), which could stand for
    an (input,target) pair z( )i = (x( )i , y( )i ) in the case of supervised learning, or
    for just an input z ( )i = x( )i in the case of unsupervised learning. The algorithm
    returns the vector of errors e for each example in D, whose mean is the estimated
    generalization error. The errors on individual examples can be used to compute a
    conﬁdence interval around the mean (equation
    ). While these conﬁdence intervals are not well-justiﬁed after the use of
    cross-validation, it is still common practice to use them to declare that algorithm
    A is better than algorithm B only if the conﬁdence interval of the error of
